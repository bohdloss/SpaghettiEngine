# SpaghettiEngine

Spaghetti engine is an open source personal project, and its main purpose is wrapping the low level libraries used into a more human friendly programming environment

### Dependencies

Its dependencies are:
- [LWJGL 3.2.3](https://github.com/LWJGL/lwjgl3)
- [JOML 1.9.25](https://github.com/JOML-CI/JOML)
Every dependency is included in the pom.xml file

### How to set it up

The best way would be to use eclipse and:
- Add this repository
- Clone it
- Import the project (or check the import option when cloning)
Spoiler ahead: it's still not ready and literally can't do anything other than display a black window
most of the work is being done in the backend and because of this it's not visible
